# DRUM RANDOMIZER     

Create a drum machine with random sounds and midi patterns generated by AI and machine learning algorithms! 

[Try out the MVP](https://goofy-austin-f95b7a.netlify.app/)

## Overview

This experimental project will help musicians to create random (experimental) drum patterns by using machine learning to organize the sounds and generate the pattern based on similar sounds and genre.    

The patterns dataset is already imported in the project includeing 32 notes per each drum rack(row)! We're using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) as audio library to setup drum rack, sampler and sequencer, [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to draw the sound graph!

## Missions      

This project uses [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) method and [magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) as open source research project to classifiy and organize the sounds and in the next step the mission will be find the best pattern based on genre for each group of sounds by AI algorithms!    

Upcoming features:
1. Make some grooves to drum machine patterns real-time using magenta machine learning tools
2. Audio visualizer while drum is playing based on genre and tempo!
3. Save the project as midi our audio file
4. Provide some output audio effects like delay or reverb
5. Make an open source drum audio library

## Contribution     

Contributions welcome seriously!!!


### As a Developer 
If you're interested to work on AI or machine learning part to find the best algorithm and method to get and organize the similar sounds you're welcome to make a PR with enough description!


### As a Musician    
If you are musician you can contribute to this project by importing new sounds dataset which could be recorded one-shot sounds or your studio! [Report bugs or issues](https://github.com/vah7id/drum-randomizer/issues)
